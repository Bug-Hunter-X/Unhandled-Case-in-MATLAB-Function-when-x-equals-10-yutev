This repository contains a MATLAB function with an uncommon bug. The function myFunction has a conditional statement that handles cases where the input x is greater than 10, less than 0, or otherwise. However, the case when x equals 10 is not explicitly handled.  The solution demonstrates how to handle this edge case by adding an explicit 'else if' condition to check if x is equal to 10.
